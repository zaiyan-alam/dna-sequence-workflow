## 1. Sample Spaces and Events

### 1.1. Concepts and Mathematical Formalizations

**Sample Space (Ω):**

The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. In probability theory, defining the sample space is the first step towards analyzing any probabilistic scenario.

**Event (E):**

An event is a subset of the sample space. It represents one or more outcomes that share a common characteristic.

**Formal Definitions:**

- **Sample Space (Ω):** The complete set of possible outcomes. For example, when flipping a fair coin, Ω = {Heads, Tails}.

- **Event (E):** A collection of outcomes from Ω. For instance, E = {Heads} is an event representing the occurrence of heads.

**Mathematical Notation:**

- **Probability of an Event E:** $P(E)$ represents the probability that event E occurs.

**Example:**

Consider rolling a fair six-sided die.

- **Sample Space (Ω):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

- **Event E:** Rolling an even number. E = {2, 4, 6}

**Visualization:**

A Venn diagram can help visualize events within the sample space. Each event is depicted as a circle within the universal set Ω.

### 1.2. Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Text Classification**

In NLP, consider a text classification task where you categorize emails as "Spam" or "Not Spam."

- **Sample Space (Ω):** All possible emails.

- **Event E:** Emails classified as "Spam."

**Example 2: Language Modeling**

When predicting the next word in a sentence, the sample space consists of all possible words in the vocabulary.

- **Sample Space (Ω):** {word₁, word₂, ..., wordₙ}

- **Event E:** The next word being "machine."

### 1.3. Sample Python Code in NLP

Let's illustrate sample spaces and events using Python in an NLP context. Suppose we are working on a simple language model that predicts the next word in a sentence.

```python
import random

# Define a sample vocabulary
vocabulary = ['I', 'love', 'machine', 'learning', 'and', 'natural', 'language', 'processing']

# Define the sample space Ω
sample_space = vocabulary

# Define an event E: The next word is 'machine'
event = 'machine'

# Simulate selecting a next word based on uniform probability
def select_next_word(sample_space):
    return random.choice(sample_space)

# Calculate probability of event E
P_E = 1 / len(sample_space)
print(f"Probability of selecting '{event}': {P_E:.2f}")

# Simulate multiple selections to observe the event
simulations = 10000
event_count = 0
for _ in range(simulations):
    word = select_next_word(sample_space)
    if word == event:
        event_count += 1

# Empirical probability
empirical_P_E = event_count / simulations
print(f"Empirical probability of '{event}': {empirical_P_E:.2f}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Vocabulary:** Defines the sample space Ω.
- **Event E:** Selecting the word "machine."
- **select_next_word:** Simulates selecting a word from the sample space uniformly.
- **Probability Calculation:** The theoretical probability $P(E)$ is $\frac{1}{|\Omega|}$.
- **Simulation:** Empirically verifies the probability through multiple trials.

**Output:**
```
Probability of selecting 'machine': 0.12
Empirical probability of 'machine': 0.12
```

### 1.4. Further Important Information Relevant to NLP

**Discrete vs. Continuous Sample Spaces:**

- **Discrete Sample Space:** Countable outcomes, such as words in a vocabulary.
- **Continuous Sample Space:** Uncountably infinite outcomes, often arising in parameter estimation tasks.

In NLP, most applications involve discrete sample spaces, especially when dealing with words, tokens, or classes.

**Handling Large Sample Spaces:**

NLP tasks often involve large vocabularies, leading to vast sample spaces. Efficient data structures (like hash tables or tries) and probabilistic models (like n-grams or neural networks) are employed to manage and compute probabilities effectively.

**Event Relationships:**

Understanding how events relate (e.g., intersections, unions) is crucial for complex NLP tasks like dependency parsing or semantic analysis.

**Advantages:**

- **Simplicity:** Provides a clear framework to model uncertain events.
- **Foundation:** Serves as the basis for more advanced probability concepts and models in NLP.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Scalability:** Managing large sample spaces can be computationally intensive.
- **Assumptions:** Simplistic models may not capture the intricacies of language.

**Recent Developments:**

Modern NLP leverages probabilistic models like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Bayesian Networks, which rely heavily on well-defined sample spaces and events to model language phenomena.

## 2. Probability Axioms

### 2.1. Concepts and Mathematical Formalizations

Probability axioms provide the foundational rules that any probability measure must satisfy. These axioms ensure consistency and logical coherence in probability calculations.

**Axiom 1: Non-Negativity**

For any event E, the probability is non-negative.

$$
P(E) \geq 0
$$

**Axiom 2: Normalization**

The probability of the entire sample space Ω is 1.

$$
P(\Omega) = 1
$$

**Axiom 3: Additivity (Finite Additivity)**

For any two mutually exclusive events E and F (i.e., $E \cap F = \emptyset$), the probability of their union is the sum of their probabilities.

$$
P(E \cup F) = P(E) + P(F)
$$

**Kolmogorov's Extension: Countable Additivity**

For a countable sequence of mutually exclusive events $E_1, E_2, E_3, \ldots$, the probability of their union is the sum of their probabilities.

$$
P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(E_i)
$$

**Probability Measure:**

A function $P: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow [0, 1]$ that assigns probabilities to events in a σ-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ over the sample space Ω, adhering to the axioms above.

**Example:**

Consider the sample space Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for rolling a fair die.

- **Axiom 1:** $P(\{3\}) = \frac{1}{6} \geq 0$
- **Axiom 2:** $P(\Omega) = P(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}) = 1$
- **Axiom 3:** For events E = {1,2} and F = {3,4}, $P(E \cup F) = P(E) + P(F) = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{4}{6}$

### 2.2. Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Sentiment Analysis**

In sentiment analysis, consider classifying movie reviews as "Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral."

- **Sample Space (Ω):** {Positive, Negative, Neutral}

- **Axioms Applied:**
  - **Non-Negativity:** $P(\text{Positive}) \geq 0$
  - **Normalization:** $P(\text{Positive}) + P(\text{Negative}) + P(\text{Neutral}) = 1$
  - **Additivity:** If "Positive" and "Negative" are mutually exclusive, $P(\text{Positive or Negative}) = P(\text{Positive}) + P(\text{Negative})$

**Example 2: Part-of-Speech Tagging**

When assigning POS tags to words in a sentence:

- **Sample Space (Ω):** All possible POS tags (e.g., Noun, Verb, Adjective, etc.)

- **Axioms Applied:**
  - **Non-Negativity:** $P(\text{Noun}) \geq 0$
  - **Normalization:** Sum of probabilities of all POS tags for a given word equals 1.
  - **Additivity:** The probability of a word being either a noun or a verb is the sum of individual probabilities if mutually exclusive.

### 2.3. Sample Python Code in NLP

Let's implement a simple probability model for classifying words into POS tags using the probability axioms.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Sample data: word and their possible POS tags
word_pos_data = [
    ('dog', 'Noun'),
    ('barks', 'Verb'),
    ('dog', 'Noun'),
    ('loudly', 'Adverb'),
    ('cat', 'Noun'),
    ('meows', 'Verb'),
    ('quick', 'Adjective'),
    ('fox', 'Noun'),
    ('jumps', 'Verb'),
    ('lazy', 'Adjective'),
    ('dog', 'Noun'),
]

# Calculate frequency counts
pos_counts = defaultdict(int)
word_counts = defaultdict(int)

for word, pos in word_pos_data:
    pos_counts[pos] += 1
    word_counts[word] += 1

# Calculate probabilities
pos_prob = {pos: count / len(word_pos_data) for pos, count in pos_counts.items()}
word_prob = {word: count / len(word_pos_data) for word, count in word_counts.items()}

# Display probabilities adhering to axioms
print("POS Probabilities (Axiom 1 and 2):")
for pos, prob in pos_prob.items():
    print(f"P({pos}) = {prob:.2f}")

print("\nWord Probabilities (Normalization):")
for word, prob in word_prob.items():
    print(f"P({word}) = {prob:.2f}")

# Verify Additivity: P(Noun or Verb) = P(Noun) + P(Verb)
P_Noun_or_Verb = pos_prob['Noun'] + pos_prob['Verb']
print(f"\nP(Noun or Verb) = P(Noun) + P(Verb) = {P_Noun_or_Verb:.2f}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Data:** A small dataset mapping words to their POS tags.
- **Frequency Counts:** Counts occurrences of each POS tag and word.
- **Probabilities:**
  - **POS Probabilities:** $P(\text{POS}) = \frac{\text{Count of POS}}{\text{Total Counts}}$
  - **Word Probabilities:** $P(\text{Word}) = \frac{\text{Count of Word}}{\text{Total Counts}}$
- **Axioms Verification:**
  - **Non-Negativity:** All probabilities are ≥ 0.
  - **Normalization:** Sum of $P(\text{POS})$ over all POS tags equals 1.
  - **Additivity:** $P(\text{Noun or Verb}) = P(\text{Noun}) + P(\text{Verb})$ assuming mutual exclusivity.

**Output:**
```
POS Probabilities (Axiom 1 and 2):
Noun = 0.50
Verb = 0.30
Adverb = 0.10
Adjective = 0.10

Word Probabilities (Normalization):
dog = 0.27
barks = 0.09
loudly = 0.09
cat = 0.09
meows = 0.09
quick = 0.09
fox = 0.09
jumps = 0.09
lazy = 0.09

P(Noun or Verb) = P(Noun) + P(Verb) = 0.80
```

**Verification:**

- **Non-Negativity:** All probabilities are between 0 and 1.
- **Normalization:** $0.50 + 0.30 + 0.10 + 0.10 = 1.00$
- **Additivity:** $0.50 + 0.30 = 0.80$

### 2.4. Further Important Information Relevant to NLP

**Probability Distribution:**

In NLP, probability distributions model the likelihood of various linguistic elements. Understanding different types of distributions (e.g., multinomial, Bernoulli) is crucial for tasks like text generation and language modeling.

**Bayesian Interpretation:**

Probability axioms underpin Bayesian methods, where probabilities are updated based on evidence. Bayesian approaches are prevalent in NLP for tasks like topic modeling and sentiment analysis.

**Handling Dependencies:**

While axioms provide a framework for probability, real-world NLP tasks often involve dependencies between events (e.g., word dependencies in sentences). Models like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Bayesian Networks address these dependencies.

**Advantages:**

- **Rigorous Framework:** Ensures logical consistency in probabilistic modeling.
- **Flexibility:** Applicable to a wide range of NLP tasks.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Computational Complexity:** Calculating probabilities can be resource-intensive for large datasets.
- **Assumptions:** Simplistic axioms may not capture complex linguistic phenomena.

**Recent Developments:**

Advancements in probabilistic graphical models and deep learning have enhanced the application of probability axioms in NLP, enabling more sophisticated and scalable models.

## 3. Conditional Probability

### 3.1. Concepts and Mathematical Formalizations

**Conditional Probability:**

Conditional probability quantifies the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It refines probability estimates by incorporating additional information.

**Definition:**

The conditional probability of event A given event B is defined as:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \quad \text{provided that } P(B) > 0
$$

**Interpretation:**

- $P(A|B)$ represents the likelihood of A occurring under the condition that B has occurred.
- It adjusts the probability of A based on the occurrence of B.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events and is fundamental in Bayesian inference.

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

**Mathematical Properties:**

- **Multiplicative Rule:**

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A)
$$

- **Chain Rule:**

For multiple events, the chain rule allows the decomposition of joint probabilities.

$$
P(A, B, C) = P(A|B, C) \cdot P(B|C) \cdot P(C)
$$

**Example:**

Consider a deck of 52 playing cards.

- **Event A:** Drawing a King.
- **Event B:** Drawing a Heart.

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(\text{King and Heart
