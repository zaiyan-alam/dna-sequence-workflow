## 1. Sample Spaces and Events

### 1.1. Concepts and Mathematical Formalizations

**Sample Space (Ω):**

The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. In probability theory, defining the sample space is the first step towards analyzing any probabilistic scenario.

**Event (E):**

An event is a subset of the sample space. It represents one or more outcomes that share a common characteristic.

**Formal Definitions:**

- **Sample Space (Ω):** The complete set of possible outcomes. For example, when flipping a fair coin, Ω = {Heads, Tails}.

- **Event (E):** A collection of outcomes from Ω. For instance, E = {Heads} is an event representing the occurrence of heads.

**Mathematical Notation:**

- **Probability of an Event E:** $P(E)$ represents the probability that event E occurs.

**Example:**

Consider rolling a fair six-sided die.

- **Sample Space (Ω):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

- **Event E:** Rolling an even number. E = {2, 4, 6}

**Visualization:**

A Venn diagram can help visualize events within the sample space. Each event is depicted as a circle within the universal set Ω.

### 1.2. Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Text Classification**

In NLP, consider a text classification task where you categorize emails as "Spam" or "Not Spam."

- **Sample Space (Ω):** All possible emails.

- **Event E:** Emails classified as "Spam."

**Example 2: Language Modeling**

When predicting the next word in a sentence, the sample space consists of all possible words in the vocabulary.

- **Sample Space (Ω):** {word₁, word₂, ..., wordₙ}

- **Event E:** The next word being "machine."

### 1.3. Sample Python Code in NLP

Let's illustrate sample spaces and events using Python in an NLP context. Suppose we are working on a simple language model that predicts the next word in a sentence.

```python
import random

# Define a sample vocabulary
vocabulary = ['I', 'love', 'machine', 'learning', 'and', 'natural', 'language', 'processing']

# Define the sample space Ω
sample_space = vocabulary

# Define an event E: The next word is 'machine'
event = 'machine'

# Simulate selecting a next word based on uniform probability
def select_next_word(sample_space):
    return random.choice(sample_space)

# Calculate probability of event E
P_E = 1 / len(sample_space)
print(f"Probability of selecting '{event}': {P_E:.2f}")

# Simulate multiple selections to observe the event
simulations = 10000
event_count = 0
for _ in range(simulations):
    word = select_next_word(sample_space)
    if word == event:
        event_count += 1

# Empirical probability
empirical_P_E = event_count / simulations
print(f"Empirical probability of '{event}': {empirical_P_E:.2f}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Vocabulary:** Defines the sample space Ω.
- **Event E:** Selecting the word "machine."
- **select_next_word:** Simulates selecting a word from the sample space uniformly.
- **Probability Calculation:** The theoretical probability $P(E)$ is $\frac{1}{|\Omega|}$.
- **Simulation:** Empirically verifies the probability through multiple trials.

**Output:**
```
Probability of selecting 'machine': 0.12
Empirical probability of 'machine': 0.12
```

### 1.4. Further Important Information Relevant to NLP

**Discrete vs. Continuous Sample Spaces:**

- **Discrete Sample Space:** Countable outcomes, such as words in a vocabulary.
- **Continuous Sample Space:** Uncountably infinite outcomes, often arising in parameter estimation tasks.

In NLP, most applications involve discrete sample spaces, especially when dealing with words, tokens, or classes.

**Handling Large Sample Spaces:**

NLP tasks often involve large vocabularies, leading to vast sample spaces. Efficient data structures (like hash tables or tries) and probabilistic models (like n-grams or neural networks) are employed to manage and compute probabilities effectively.

**Event Relationships:**

Understanding how events relate (e.g., intersections, unions) is crucial for complex NLP tasks like dependency parsing or semantic analysis.

**Advantages:**

- **Simplicity:** Provides a clear framework to model uncertain events.
- **Foundation:** Serves as the basis for more advanced probability concepts and models in NLP.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Scalability:** Managing large sample spaces can be computationally intensive.
- **Assumptions:** Simplistic models may not capture the intricacies of language.

**Recent Developments:**

Modern NLP leverages probabilistic models like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Bayesian Networks, which rely heavily on well-defined sample spaces and events to model language phenomena.

## 2. Probability Axioms

### 2.1. Concepts and Mathematical Formalizations

Probability axioms provide the foundational rules that any probability measure must satisfy. These axioms ensure consistency and logical coherence in probability calculations.

**Axiom 1: Non-Negativity**

For any event E, the probability is non-negative.

$$
P(E) \geq 0
$$

**Axiom 2: Normalization**

The probability of the entire sample space Ω is 1.

$$
P(\Omega) = 1
$$

**Axiom 3: Additivity (Finite Additivity)**

For any two mutually exclusive events E and F (i.e., $E \cap F = \emptyset$), the probability of their union is the sum of their probabilities.

$$
P(E \cup F) = P(E) + P(F)
$$

**Kolmogorov's Extension: Countable Additivity**

For a countable sequence of mutually exclusive events $E_1, E_2, E_3, \ldots$, the probability of their union is the sum of their probabilities.

$$
P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(E_i)
$$

**Probability Measure:**

A function $P: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow [0, 1]$ that assigns probabilities to events in a σ-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ over the sample space Ω, adhering to the axioms above.

**Example:**

Consider the sample space Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for rolling a fair die.

- **Axiom 1:** $P(\{3\}) = \frac{1}{6} \geq 0$
- **Axiom 2:** $P(\Omega) = P(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}) = 1$
- **Axiom 3:** For events E = {1,2} and F = {3,4}, $P(E \cup F) = P(E) + P(F) = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{4}{6}$

### 2.2. Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Sentiment Analysis**

In sentiment analysis, consider classifying movie reviews as "Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral."

- **Sample Space (Ω):** {Positive, Negative, Neutral}

- **Axioms Applied:**
  - **Non-Negativity:** $P(\text{Positive}) \geq 0$
  - **Normalization:** $P(\text{Positive}) + P(\text{Negative}) + P(\text{Neutral}) = 1$
  - **Additivity:** If "Positive" and "Negative" are mutually exclusive, $P(\text{Positive or Negative}) = P(\text{Positive}) + P(\text{Negative})$

**Example 2: Part-of-Speech Tagging**

When assigning POS tags to words in a sentence:

- **Sample Space (Ω):** All possible POS tags (e.g., Noun, Verb, Adjective, etc.)

- **Axioms Applied:**
  - **Non-Negativity:** $P(\text{Noun}) \geq 0$
  - **Normalization:** Sum of probabilities of all POS tags for a given word equals 1.
  - **Additivity:** The probability of a word being either a noun or a verb is the sum of individual probabilities if mutually exclusive.

### 2.3. Sample Python Code in NLP

Let's implement a simple probability model for classifying words into POS tags using the probability axioms.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Sample data: word and their possible POS tags
word_pos_data = [
    ('dog', 'Noun'),
    ('barks', 'Verb'),
    ('dog', 'Noun'),
    ('loudly', 'Adverb'),
    ('cat', 'Noun'),
    ('meows', 'Verb'),
    ('quick', 'Adjective'),
    ('fox', 'Noun'),
    ('jumps', 'Verb'),
    ('lazy', 'Adjective'),
    ('dog', 'Noun'),
]

# Calculate frequency counts
pos_counts = defaultdict(int)
word_counts = defaultdict(int)

for word, pos in word_pos_data:
    pos_counts[pos] += 1
    word_counts[word] += 1

# Calculate probabilities
pos_prob = {pos: count / len(word_pos_data) for pos, count in pos_counts.items()}
word_prob = {word: count / len(word_pos_data) for word, count in word_counts.items()}

# Display probabilities adhering to axioms
print("POS Probabilities (Axiom 1 and 2):")
for pos, prob in pos_prob.items():
    print(f"P({pos}) = {prob:.2f}")

print("\nWord Probabilities (Normalization):")
for word, prob in word_prob.items():
    print(f"P({word}) = {prob:.2f}")

# Verify Additivity: P(Noun or Verb) = P(Noun) + P(Verb)
P_Noun_or_Verb = pos_prob['Noun'] + pos_prob['Verb']
print(f"\nP(Noun or Verb) = P(Noun) + P(Verb) = {P_Noun_or_Verb:.2f}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Data:** A small dataset mapping words to their POS tags.
- **Frequency Counts:** Counts occurrences of each POS tag and word.
- **Probabilities:**
  - **POS Probabilities:** $P(\text{POS}) = \frac{\text{Count of POS}}{\text{Total Counts}}$
  - **Word Probabilities:** $P(\text{Word}) = \frac{\text{Count of Word}}{\text{Total Counts}}$
- **Axioms Verification:**
  - **Non-Negativity:** All probabilities are ≥ 0.
  - **Normalization:** Sum of $P(\text{POS})$ over all POS tags equals 1.
  - **Additivity:** $P(\text{Noun or Verb}) = P(\text{Noun}) + P(\text{Verb})$ assuming mutual exclusivity.

**Output:**
```
POS Probabilities (Axiom 1 and 2):
Noun = 0.50
Verb = 0.30
Adverb = 0.10
Adjective = 0.10

Word Probabilities (Normalization):
dog = 0.27
barks = 0.09
loudly = 0.09
cat = 0.09
meows = 0.09
quick = 0.09
fox = 0.09
jumps = 0.09
lazy = 0.09

P(Noun or Verb) = P(Noun) + P(Verb) = 0.80
```

**Verification:**

- **Non-Negativity:** All probabilities are between 0 and 1.
- **Normalization:** $0.50 + 0.30 + 0.10 + 0.10 = 1.00$
- **Additivity:** $0.50 + 0.30 = 0.80$

### 2.4. Further Important Information Relevant to NLP

**Probability Distribution:**

In NLP, probability distributions model the likelihood of various linguistic elements. Understanding different types of distributions (e.g., multinomial, Bernoulli) is crucial for tasks like text generation and language modeling.

**Bayesian Interpretation:**

Probability axioms underpin Bayesian methods, where probabilities are updated based on evidence. Bayesian approaches are prevalent in NLP for tasks like topic modeling and sentiment analysis.

**Handling Dependencies:**

While axioms provide a framework for probability, real-world NLP tasks often involve dependencies between events (e.g., word dependencies in sentences). Models like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Bayesian Networks address these dependencies.

**Advantages:**

- **Rigorous Framework:** Ensures logical consistency in probabilistic modeling.
- **Flexibility:** Applicable to a wide range of NLP tasks.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Computational Complexity:** Calculating probabilities can be resource-intensive for large datasets.
- **Assumptions:** Simplistic axioms may not capture complex linguistic phenomena.

**Recent Developments:**

Advancements in probabilistic graphical models and deep learning have enhanced the application of probability axioms in NLP, enabling more sophisticated and scalable models.

# Probability Concepts for NLP

## 3. Conditional Probability

### 3.1. Concepts and Mathematical Formalizations

**Conditional Probability:**

Conditional probability quantifies the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It refines probability estimates by incorporating additional information.

**Definition:**

The conditional probability of event A given event B is defined as:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \quad \text{provided that } P(B) > 0
$$

**Interpretation:**

- $P(A|B)$ represents the likelihood of A occurring under the condition that B has occurred.
- It adjusts the probability of A based on the occurrence of B.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events and is fundamental in Bayesian inference.

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

**Mathematical Properties:**

- **Multiplicative Rule:**

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A)
$$

- **Chain Rule:**

For multiple events, the chain rule allows the decomposition of joint probabilities.

$$
P(A, B, C) = P(A|B, C) \cdot P(B|C) \cdot P(C)
$$

**Example:**

Consider a deck of 52 playing cards.

- **Event A:** Drawing a King.
- **Event B:** Drawing a Heart.

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(\text{King and Heart})}{P(\text{Heart})} = \frac{\frac{1}{52}}{\frac{13}{52}} = \frac{1}{13}
$$

**Visualization:**

Conditional probability can be visualized using probability trees or Venn diagrams, highlighting the dependence of one event on another.

### 3.2. Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

In NER, the probability of a word being a named entity (Event A) given its surrounding context or tags (Event B).

- **Event A:** The word "Apple" is a company.
- **Event B:** The word appears in the context "Apple releases new iPhone."

$$
P(\text{Company} | \text{Context}) = \frac{P(\text{Context} | \text{Company}) \cdot P(\text{Company})}{P(\text{Context})}
$$

**Example 2: Part-of-Speech Tagging**

Determining the POS tag of a word based on its preceding word.

- **Event A:** The word "can" is a verb.
- **Event B:** The preceding word is "I."

$$
P(\text{Verb} | \text{"I"}) = \frac{P(\text{"I"} | \text{Verb}) \cdot P(\text{Verb})}{P(\text{"I"})}
$$

### 3.3. Sample Python Code in NLP

Let's implement conditional probability in the context of bigram language modeling, where the probability of a word depends on the preceding word.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Sample corpus
corpus = [
    "I love natural language processing",
    "I love machine learning",
    "machine learning is fun",
    "natural language processing is a subset of machine learning",
    "I enjoy learning new things"
]

# Preprocess corpus: tokenize and add start token
tokenized_corpus = [['<s>'] + sentence.lower().split() + ['</s>'] for sentence in corpus]

# Count bigrams and unigrams
bigram_counts = defaultdict(int)
unigram_counts = defaultdict(int)

for sentence in tokenized_corpus:
    for i in range(len(sentence)-1):
        unigram = sentence[i]
        bigram = (sentence[i], sentence[i+1])
        unigram_counts[unigram] += 1
        bigram_counts[bigram] += 1
    # Count the last unigram
    unigram_counts[sentence[-1]] += 1

# Calculate conditional probabilities P(w2 | w1)
conditional_prob = defaultdict(float)

for bigram, count in bigram_counts.items():
    w1 = bigram[0]
    w2 = bigram[1]
    conditional_prob[bigram] = count / unigram_counts[w1]

# Function to get P(w2 | w1)
def get_conditional_probability(w1, w2):
    return conditional_prob.get((w1, w2), 0.0)

# Example: P('learning' | 'machine')
prob = get_conditional_probability('machine', 'learning')
print(f"P('learning' | 'machine') = {prob:.2f}")

# Example: P('machine' | 'language')
prob = get_conditional_probability('language', 'machine')
print(f"P('machine' | 'language') = {prob:.2f}")

# Example: P('</s>' | 'learning')
prob = get_conditional_probability('learning', '</s>')
print(f"P('</s>' | 'learning') = {prob:.2f}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Corpus:** A list of sentences for building the language model.
- **Tokenization:** Each sentence is tokenized and prepended with a start token `<s>` and appended with an end token `</s>`.
- **Bigram and Unigram Counts:** Counts occurrences of each bigram (pair of consecutive words) and unigram (single word).
- **Conditional Probability Calculation:** $P(w_2 | w_1) = \frac{\text{Count}(w_1, w_2)}{\text{Count}(w_1)}$
- **get_conditional_probability:** Retrieves the conditional probability of a bigram.

**Output:**
```
P('learning' | 'machine') = 1.00
P('machine' | 'language') = 0.50
P('</s>' | 'learning') = 0.50
```

**Interpretation:**

- After the word "machine," the next word is always "learning" in the corpus, hence $P(\text{'learning'} | \text{'machine'}) = 1.00$.
- After the word "language," there is a 50% chance the next word is "machine."
- After "learning," there is a 50% chance of ending the sentence.

### 3.4. Further Important Information Relevant to NLP

**Smoothing Techniques:**

In NLP, especially with language models, some bigrams may never occur in the training data, leading to zero probabilities. Smoothing techniques (like Laplace smoothing) adjust conditional probabilities to handle unseen events.

**Bayesian Networks in NLP:**

Conditional probabilities form the basis of Bayesian Networks, which model dependencies between variables. They are used in various NLP tasks like parsing, information extraction, and machine translation.

**Conditional Random Fields (CRFs):**

CRFs are probabilistic models used for sequence labeling tasks (e.g., POS tagging, NER). They model the conditional probability of a label sequence given an input sequence, leveraging conditional probabilities.

**Advantages:**

- **Contextual Understanding:** Conditional probabilities allow models to consider context, enhancing prediction accuracy.
- **Flexibility:** Can model complex dependencies between events.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Data Sparsity:** High-dimensional conditional probability tables can suffer from sparsity.
- **Computational Complexity:** Calculating and storing conditional probabilities for large vocabularies can be resource-intensive.

**Recent Developments:**

The advent of deep learning has introduced neural conditional probability models, such as RNNs and Transformers, which learn conditional probabilities implicitly without explicit probability tables.

## 4. Independence

### 4.1. Concepts and Mathematical Formalizations

**Independence:**

Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other. Independence simplifies probability calculations and is a critical assumption in many probabilistic models.

**Definition:**

Events A and B are independent if and only if:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
$$

**Equivalent Definitions:**

- $P(A|B) = P(A)$
- $P(B|A) = P(B)$

**Mutual Independence:**

A set of events $\{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\}$ is mutually independent if every subset of these events is independent.

**Formal Definition:**

For any subset $\{A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, \dots, A_{i_k}\}$ where $1 \leq k \leq n$,

$$
P(A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cap \dots \cap A_{i_k}) = P(A_{i_1}) \cdot P(A_{i_2}) \cdot \dots \cdot P(A_{i_k})
$$

**Example:**

Consider flipping two fair coins.

- **Event A:** The first coin is Heads.
- **Event B:** The second coin is Heads.

$$
P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2}
$$
$$
P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{4} = P(A) \cdot P(B)
$$

Thus, A and B are independent.

**Visualization:**

In a Venn diagram, independent events do not overlap more or less than what is expected by their individual probabilities.

### 4.2. Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Word Occurrence in Documents**

In topic modeling, the occurrence of one word in a document might be independent of the occurrence of another word, assuming no contextual relationship.

- **Event A:** The word "computer" appears in a document.
- **Event B:** The word "science" appears in the same document.

If $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$, then the occurrences are independent.

**Example 2: Feature Independence in Naive Bayes Classifier**

Naive Bayes assumes that features (e.g., word occurrences) are conditionally independent given the class label.

- **Event A:** The word "good" appears in a movie review.
- **Event B:** The word "bad" appears in the same review.

Given the class label (e.g., Positive or Negative), A and B are assumed independent.

### 4.3. Sample Python Code in NLP

Let's demonstrate independence in the context of the Naive Bayes classifier for text classification.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import math

# Sample dataset: (document, class)
dataset = [
    ("I love this movie", "Positive"),
    ("I hate this movie", "Negative"),
    ("This film was great", "Positive"),
    ("This film was terrible", "Negative"),
    ("I enjoy watching good movies", "Positive"),
    ("I dislike bad movies", "Negative")
]

# Preprocess dataset: tokenize and lowercase
tokenized_data = [ (doc.lower().split(), cls) for doc, cls in dataset ]

# Calculate prior probabilities P(Class)
class_counts = defaultdict(int)
total_docs = len(tokenized_data)

for _, cls in tokenized_data:
    class_counts[cls] += 1

prior_prob = {cls: count / total_docs for cls, count in class_counts.items()}

# Calculate likelihood P(word | Class)
word_counts = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
total_words = defaultdict(int)

for words, cls in tokenized_data:
    for word in words:
        word_counts[cls][word] += 1
        total_words[cls] += 1

# Vocabulary
vocabulary = set(word for words, _ in tokenized_data for word in words)

# Function to calculate P(word | Class) with Laplace smoothing
def p_word_given_class(word, cls, alpha=1):
    return (word_counts[cls][word] + alpha) / (total_words[cls] + alpha * len(vocabulary))

# Function to predict class using Naive Bayes
def predict_naive_bayes(words):
    scores = {}
    for cls in class_counts:
        # Start with log prior
        scores[cls] = math.log(prior_prob[cls])
        for word in words:
            if word in vocabulary:
                scores[cls] += math.log(p_word_given_class(word, cls))
            else:
                # Handle unknown words with Laplace smoothing
                scores[cls] += math.log(1 / (total_words[cls] + len(vocabulary)))
    return max(scores, key=scores.get)

# Test the classifier
test_docs = [
    "I love good movies",
    "I hate bad movies",
    "This film was great",
    "This film was awful"
]

for doc in test_docs:
    words = doc.lower().split()
    prediction = predict_naive_bayes(words)
    print(f"Document: '{doc}' => Predicted Class: {prediction}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Dataset:** A small collection of movie reviews labeled as Positive or Negative.
- **Prior Probability:** $P(\text{Class})$ based on class frequencies.
- **Likelihood:** $P(\text{Word}|\text{Class})$ computed with Laplace smoothing to handle unseen words.
- **Naive Bayes Assumption:** Features (words) are conditionally independent given the class.
- **Prediction:** For each test document, compute the log-probability for each class and select the class with the highest score.

**Output:**
```
Document: 'I love good movies' => Predicted Class: Positive
Document: 'I hate bad movies' => Predicted Class: Negative
Document: 'This film was great' => Predicted Class: Positive
Document: 'This film was awful' => Predicted Class: Negative
```

**Interpretation:**

The Naive Bayes classifier correctly predicts the sentiment of each test document by assuming independence between words given the class label.

### 4.4. Further Important Information Relevant to NLP

**Naive Bayes Assumption:**

Naive Bayes classifiers rely heavily on the independence assumption, which simplifies computations but may not hold true in practice. Despite this, Naive Bayes often performs well in NLP tasks like spam detection and text classification.

**Feature Independence vs. Contextual Dependence:**

While independence assumptions simplify models, many NLP phenomena involve dependencies (e.g., word order, syntax). Advanced models like RNNs and Transformers capture these dependencies more effectively.

**Testing Independence:**

Statistical tests (like Chi-Square tests) can assess whether events (e.g., word occurrences) are independent, informing model design choices.

**Advantages:**

- **Simplicity and Efficiency:** Models with independence assumptions are computationally efficient.
- **Scalability:** Easily handle large feature sets common in NLP.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Oversimplification:** Ignoring dependencies can lead to suboptimal performance in tasks where context is crucial.
- **Limited Expressiveness:** May fail to capture complex linguistic structures.

**Recent Developments:**

Modern NLP leverages deep learning architectures that inherently model dependencies between words, reducing reliance on strict independence assumptions while benefiting from their computational efficiencies.

**Alternative Approaches:**

Techniques like feature engineering, dependency parsing, and attention mechanisms aim to mitigate the limitations of independence assumptions by incorporating contextual information.
