Getting started
===============

To get started, use a web browser and log in to https://access.pegasus.isi.edu . Use your ACCESS credentials to log in and start a Jupyter notebook
From there, start a shell by clicking the menu (Clusters > Shell), and check out the repostitory:

![Shell Access In Jupyter](./images/terminal-start.png)


```
$ git clone https://github.com/pegasus-isi/ACCESS-Pegasus-Examples.git
```

In Jupyter, navigate to the example you are interested in, and step through the notebook. Once the workflow is submitted, you have to add compute resources with HTCondor Annex.

For first time users, we highly recommend to do the notebooks in order, as they build up on concepts in the previous notebooks.
