Alphafold Pegasus Workflow

A Pegasus Workflow for running Alphafold model's inference pipeline regarding protein structure
prediction. The current workflow is regarding the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) and 
Feature Generation, which produce a features.pkl file that can be later used in structure inference
stage using the Alphafold model parameters.

The workflow is currently limited to the Alphafold monomer-system, thus, there is currently no
options for model_presets. The workflow does supports both Database presets of Alphafold :
