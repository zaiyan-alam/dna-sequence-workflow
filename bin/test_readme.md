# Alphafold Pegasus Workflow

A Pegasus Workflow for running [Alphafold](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold) model's inference pipeline regarding protein structure
prediction. The current workflow is regarding the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) and 
Feature Generation, which produce a `features.pkl` file that can be later used in protein structure inference
stage using the Alphafold model parameters.

The workflow is currently limited to the Alphafold monomer-system, thus, there is currently no
options for model_presets. The workflow does supports both Database presets of Alphafold :
